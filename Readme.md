Small game project with Autodesk logos, it is just finding out a correct
logos in different positions. And will calculate your ranking of click number 
when you complete the game.  

To play with this, you need to do the following steps:

1. be sure to install node.js first

2. use "npm install" to install all the dependent modules

3. Install Mongodb, and run it as mongod from command line (make sure you create the data folder as c:\data\db\ by yourself)

4. If you want to debug NodeJs at server, please refer my blog http://www.cnblogs.com/johnonsoftware/articles/3995174.html

5. run server by command "node restApi.js"

6. Run http://localhost:4711/, you can play the game, and it will give you the rank when you successfully passed. (to save time, you just need to pick one pair)


Note: This is just a technique verification, still much to improve.
